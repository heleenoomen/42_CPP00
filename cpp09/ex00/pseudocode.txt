* load database into a std::map<std::string, float>
* key = date (string), value = exchange rate (float)

* go line by line throug input file
* search the map using upper_bound to find the first key greater than the date we are searching for
* move the iterator one step back, get the corresponding value (exchange rate)
* calculate the value
* print
