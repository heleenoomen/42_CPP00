PmergeMe:
  for all arguments in argument in argument vector:
    * add each argument to vector of ints v_
    * add each argument to list of ints l_
  
  * call SortVector
  * call SortList

SortVector: (takes v_ from PmergeMe)
  Contains: (pending_(v_), mainChain_)
  SortPairs:
    * make a vector of pairs of integers pairs_ out of v_
    * sort each pair so that first >= second
    * sort pairs_ based on first elements
    * put all first elements in mainChain_ vector
    * put all second elements in pending_ vector
