## MutantStack with STL & Algorithm
### Exercise 02:

> Now, time to move on more serious things. Let’s develop something weird.
> 
> The `std::stack` container is very nice. Unfortunately, it is one of the only STL Containers that is NOT iterable. That’s too bad.
> 
> But why would we accept this? Especially if we can take the liberty of butchering the
> original stack to create missing features.
> 
> To repair this injustice, you have to make the `std::stack` container iterable.
> 
> Write a MutantStack class. It will be implemented in terms of a `std::stack`.
> 
> It will offer all its member functions, plus an additional feature: iterators.
> 
> Of course, you will write and turn in your own tests to ensure everything works as
> expected
