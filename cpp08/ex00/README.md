# CPP Module 08 - Standard Template & Algorithm libraries<b>
### Exercise 00:

> <i>Write a function template easyfind that accepts a type T. It takes two parameters.
> The first one has type T and the second one is an integer.<br>
> 
> Assuming T is a container of integers, this function has to find the first occurrence
> of the second parameter in the first parameter.<br>
> 
> If no occurrence is found, you can either throw an exception or return an error value
> of your choice. If you need some inspiration, analyze how standard containers behave.<br>
> 
> Of course, implement and turn in your own tests to ensure everything works as expected.</i>
