/* bad idea to use malloc in cpp
If allocate objects with malloc, it will blow up.
it does not call the constructor of your object
and it does not call the destructor when you free

new and delete will handle it cleanly for you*/

/* new and delete for arrays:
  
  the above allocates 42 students dynamically and contiguously in heap.
  Please not that it only works with constructors that do not take parameters.
  You have to find work arounds for initializing the array.
