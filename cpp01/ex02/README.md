## Pointers vs References
### Exercise 02:

> <i>Write a program that contains:
>
> * A string variable initialized to `"HI THIS IS BRAIN"`.
> * `stringPTR`: A pointer to the string.
> * `stringREF`: A reference to the string.
> 
> Your program has to print:
> * The memory address of the string variable.
> * The memory address held by `stringPTR`.
> * The memory address held by `stringREF`.
> 
> And then:
> * The value of the string variable.
> * The value pointed to by `stringPTR`.
> * The value pointed to by `stringREF`.
>
> The goal of this exercise is to demystify references. Although there are some little differences, this is another syntax
for something you already do: address manipulation.</i>
