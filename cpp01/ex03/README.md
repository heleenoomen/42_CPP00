## Pointers vs References (2)
### Exercise 02:

> Implement a Weapon class that has:
> * A private attribute `type`, which is a string.
> * A `getType()` member function that returns a const reference to `type`.
> * A `setType()` member function that sets `type` using the new one passed as parameter.
>
> Now, create two classes: <b>HumanA</b> and <b>HumanB</b>. They both have a Weapon and a
> name. They also have a member function `attack()` that displays (of course, without the
> angle brackets):
>
> ``<name> attacks with their <weapon type>``
>
> HumanA and HumanB are almost the same except for these two tiny details:
> * While HumanA takes the Weapon in its constructor, HumanB doesnâ€™t.
  > * HumanB may <b>not always</b> have a Weapon, whereas HumanA will <b>always</b> be armed.
